# Colive-Voice-Stress
Python notebook to analyze voice signatures of momentary stress

This notebook contains the code to run OLS regressions on the voice signatures associated with stress. The analysis is divided by gender and language. The input should be population files (stress levels and sociodemographic characteristics) and the extracted features from the DisVoice toolkit. To extract features from raw audio files, we refer to the DisVoice documentation: https://disvoice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
